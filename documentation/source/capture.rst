How to generate a memory trace
------------------------------

The first thing you will need to do is generate a memory trace. Currently,
this is done via the Radeon Developer Panel. Read the documentation provided
with this distribution for information on how to create a memory trace. This
can be obtained from within the Radeon Developer Panel or from the link on the
Radeon Memory Visualizer “Welcome” view. The documentation is also available
online at:
