Snapshot delta
--------------

The snapshot delta gives a high level overview of the differences between two
snapshots. It shows the difference in the number of allocations and resources
for each heap type.

The carousel works in a similar way to the carousel in the **Resource list** pane
but now shows the differences between the 2 snapshots, indicating such things as
whether memory consumption has gone up or down.

The "**Switch snapshots**" button in the top right corner under the settings
tab can be used to switch the snapshots.
