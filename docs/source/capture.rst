How to generate a memory trace
------------------------------

The first thing you will need to do is generate a memory trace. Currently,
this is done via the Radeon Developer Panel 2.0. Read the documentation
provided with this distribution for information on how to create a memory
trace. This can be obtained from within the Radeon Developer Panel or from
the link on the Radeon Memory Visualizer “Welcome” view.
