Radeon Memory Visualizer V1.1 11-24-2020
----------------------------------------

V1.1 Changes
------------------------------------

1) Add support for showing aliased resources in the allocation overview and allocation explorer panes.
2) Rework the resource "Filter by size" slider throughout so that the resources are more evenly distributed.
3) Empty tables show a graphical indication and description as to why the table is empty.
4) Add "color by commit type" coloring mode.
5) Add search box and filter by allocation size to the allocation table in the allocation explorer pane.
6) Show unmapped resource memory in residency donut in the resource details pane.
7) Bug/stability fixes.

Known Issues
------------------------------------

(1a) More than a single active device at a time within a single application is not supported. In this case, only the first device will be traced.
(1b) More than a single Vulkan/DX12 process at a time is not supported.  Only the first started application will be traced.
(2) In the Snapshots|Resource details pane, Physical memory mapped events may be shown before virtual allocate events.
(3) Some of the Pane navigation shortcuts may conflict with the keyboard shortcuts used by the Radeon Settings (such as ALT-R). It is recommended to remap the Radeon settings so they don't conflict.
(4) Some UI elements do not rescale properly when the OS's DPI scale settings are dynamically changed, or when dragging RMV between two monitors with different DPI scales. Close and re-open RMV to view at proper sizes.
(5) Running multiple instances of the Radeon Developer Panel is not supported.
(6) Sparse texture are not fully supported.
(7) When tracing an application that uses a launcher, or an application that creates multiple devices, it is possible that more than one trace file will be written to disk. In the case of the launcher, adding the launcher's executable name to the Blocked applications list in the Radeon Developer Panel should prevent multiple trace files. Restarting the Radeon Developer Panel may be required before attempting to trace again.
