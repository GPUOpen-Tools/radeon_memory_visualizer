Radeonâ„¢ Memory Visualizer V1.4 04-21-2022
-----------------------------------------

V1.4 Changes
------------------------------------
1) Support added for traces taken from systems with LPDDR4/5 & DDR5 memory.
2) Support for traces taken with Smart Access Memory (SAM) enabled.
3) Bugs/stability fixes.

Known Issues
------------------------------------

(1a) More than a single active device at a time within a single application is not supported. In this case, only the first device will be traced.
(1b) More than a single Vulkan/DX12 process at a time is not supported.  Only the first started application will be traced.
(2) In the Snapshots|Resource details pane, Physical memory mapped events may be shown before virtual allocate events.
(3) Some of the Pane navigation shortcuts may conflict with the keyboard shortcuts used by the Radeon Settings (such as ALT-R). It is recommended to remap the Radeon settings so they don't conflict.
(4) Some UI elements do not rescale properly when the OS's DPI scale settings are dynamically changed, or when dragging RMV between two monitors with different DPI scales. Close and re-open RMV to view at proper sizes.
(5) Running multiple instances of the Radeon Developer Panel is not supported.
(6) Sparse texture are not fully supported.
(7) When tracing an application that uses a launcher, or an application that creates multiple devices, it is possible that more than one trace file will be written to disk. In the case of the launcher, adding the launcher's executable name to the Blocked applications list in the Radeon Developer Panel should prevent multiple trace files. Restarting the Radeon Developer Panel may be required before attempting to trace again.
(8) If a memory dump is created by shutting down the application being traced and there are a large number of resource names, some names may not be included in the RMV file.  The work-around is to use the Dump trace button in the Radeon Developer Panel and wait for the button to be disabled before shutting down the application.  This gives the buffered names a chance to be processed.
