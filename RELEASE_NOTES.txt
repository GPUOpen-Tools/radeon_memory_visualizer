Radeon™ Memory Visualizer V1.7 09/21/2023
-----------------------------------------

V1.7 Changes
------------------------------------
1) Aliased Resource size calculation improvements on Resource overview pane.
2) Support for loading Radeon GPU Detective crash dump files.
3) Resource naming and implicit buffer filtering made more reliable in DX12.
4) Support for hours added (formatted as "H:MM:SS.clk_cycles" and included with the CTRL+T time-cycling shortcut keys).
5) System memory type added to device configuration pane (e.g. DDR4).
6) Bug/stability fixes.

Known Issues
------------------------------------

(1a) More than a single active device at a time within a single application is not supported. In this case, only the first device will be traced.
(1b) More than a single Vulkan/DX12 process at a time is not supported.  Only the first started application will be traced.
(2) In the Snapshots|Resource details pane, Physical memory mapped events may be shown before virtual allocate events.
(3) Some UI elements do not rescale properly when the OS's DPI scale settings are dynamically changed, or when dragging RMV between two monitors with different DPI scales. Close and re-open RMV to view at proper sizes.
(4) Running multiple instances of the Radeon Developer Panel is not supported.
(5) Sparse texture are not fully supported.
(6) When tracing an application that uses a launcher, or an application that creates multiple devices, it is possible that more than one trace file will be written to disk. In the case of the launcher, adding the launcher's executable name to the Blocked applications list in the Radeon Developer Panel should prevent multiple trace files. Restarting the Radeon Developer Panel may be required before attempting to trace again.
(7) If a memory dump is created by shutting down the application being traced and there are a large number of resource names, some names may not be included in the RMV file.  The work-around is to use the Dump trace button in the Radeon Developer Panel and wait for the button to be disabled before shutting down the application.  This gives the buffered names a chance to be processed.
(8) The Shader core clock frequency and Video memory clock frequency for memory traces captured on Linux may be incorrectly displayed as 0.
(9) The Device name may be blank for memory traces captured on Linux with some APUs.
(10) Installations of Ubuntu 20.04 or newer may have the RADV open source Vulkan® driver installed by default on the system. As a result, after an amdgpu-pro driver install, the default Vulkan ICD may be the RADV ICD. In order to capture a memory trace, Vulkan applications must be using the amdgpu-pro Vulkan ICD. The default Vulkan ICD can be overridden by setting the following environment variable before launching a Vulkan application: VK_ICD_FILENAMES=/etc/vulkan/icd.d/amd_icd64.json
